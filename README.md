## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Git
- A local web server (Python, Node.js, or any HTTP server)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/god-hand1/Vibrant-Academy.git
cd Vibrant-Academy

# Serve using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js http-server
npx http-server -p 8000

# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

### Development Guidelines

The application is built with vanilla JavaScript and requires no build process. All code is directly editable and testable in the browser. When adding new materials:

1. Place PDF files in the appropriate directory under `Vibrant Academy Modules/`
2. Update `data.js` with the new material information
3. Test the search functionality
4. Verify PDF loading in both desktop and mobile views
5. Update the service worker cache version if needed

## Technical Architecture
